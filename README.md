#### Authentication service have to manage and validate the login and sign up of the specific user type such as Employee or the Client.

###### ElectroGrid (EG) is the company that maintains the power grid of the country. Although they already have a system for monitoring the power consumption of the users, automatically generating and sending monthly bills to users, and accepting online payments, they face some problems because the current system is not scalable with the growing number of stakeholders of EG.

###### This project aims to develop a highly scalable online platform for EG with the capability of catering to the growing number of users along with the functionalities available in the current system. Initially, all the types of stakeholders, requirements, workflows and possible web services were identified which are needed to implement the system as microservices. 

###### Then the system was developed, integrated, and tested by designing APIs, identifying database requirements for each service, and selecting tools while following the Agile software development methodology. Through the fully implemented system, all of the stakeholders are feasible to use the current system functionalities (monitoring, billing, payments, etc) without facing problems due to the growing number of users.
